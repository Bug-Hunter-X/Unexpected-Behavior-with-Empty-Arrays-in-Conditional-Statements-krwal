This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in MATLAB related to the handling of empty arrays in conditional statements.  The `bug.m` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.m` provides a corrected version. The issue stems from MATLAB's implicit type conversion and how empty arrays can affect conditional logic.  The solution emphasizes explicit checks and safer practices.
